# What is a Business?

It may seem like a silly question but it's really not. There are many types of business in the UK. These range from small firms owned and run by just one self-employed person, through to large companies which employ thousands of staff all over the world.

A **business** is any organisation that makes **goods** or provides **services**. Businesses exist to provide **goods** or **services**. **Goods** are physical products such as burgers or cars. **Services** are non-physical items such as hairdressing. Customer needs are the wants and desires of buyers.

Nearly half a million businesses start up each year. A business start- up is a new firm operating in a market for the first time.

The vast majority of businesses are very small and operate in the service sector.


## Why start a business?

> Any activity or enterprise thats being carried out for the purpose of profit - Deborah Meaden

There are a few reasons but mainly people start business is to turn a profit. But not all businesses strive to turn a profit. Imagine you started one when the goal of making the same money as your full-time job, but that gives you twice the holiday.

> The economy is divided into different business sectors and the businesses within them exist to provide goods or services. All businesses have inputs and outputs and must add value during production.

Businesses buy the products they need from suppliers – firms selling products to other businesses - and sell to customers. The individual who uses the product is called a consumer. Sometimes the customer and consumer are different people - for example, parents buy a pen for their child to use at school.

Businesses sell to customers in markets. A market is any place where buyers and sellers meet to trade products - this can be a high street shop or a website.

Businesses are likely to be in competition with other firms offering similar products.


## Adding value

In order to create goods and services, a business buys or hires inputs such as raw materials, equipment, buildings and staff. These inputs are transformed into outputs called products. These products are the goods and services used by consumers. Production is the business activity of using resources to make goods and services.

A business adds value when the selling price of an item produced is higher than the cost of all the resources used to make it. Think of a pair of designer sunglasses which sell for £100. If the cost of the materials, employees, marketing and all other inputs used in making one set of sunglasses is just £20, then £80 worth of value has been added by the firm during production.
