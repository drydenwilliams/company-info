# Full-time to Self employed

Since starting a [Fika Studio](https://www.fika.studio/) I've had so many questions on becoming self employed. 

It's not easy starting a business if you've never studied it or been around one before. There are loads of terms that our extremely confusing. I've created this document to hopfully helpout with some terms and things to rememeber.

One of the most important things that sound really obvisious is getting your accounts in order. As a freelancer or a business this is a must. There is some great software to help with this and I like [Freeagent](https://www.freeagent.com/).
