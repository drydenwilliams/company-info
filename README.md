# Full-time to Self employed

Since starting a [Fika Studio](https://www.fika.studio/) I've had so many questions on becoming self employed. 

It's not easy starting a business if you've never studied it or been around one before. There are loads of terms that our extremely confusing. I've created this document to hopfully helpout with some terms and things to rememeber.

One of the most important things that sound really obvisious is getting your accounts in order. As a freelancer or a business this is a must. There is some great software to help with this and I like [Freeagent](https://www.freeagent.com/).

### <a name="paye"></a>[PAYE](https://www.freeagent.com/glossary/PAYE/)

> PAYE is short for Pay As You Earn. It's not a tax in its own right, it's a system that HMRC use to collect income tax.

The PAYE system is HM Revenue and Customs' ( HMRC ) system is used to collect tax from certain sources of income, such as wages, and private pensions, Income Tax and National Insurance from employment.

Most UK taxpayers are entitled to receive a certain amount of income tax-free each year. This is called the 'personal allowance'. If your income is over a certain level, your personal allowance is reduced proportionately. HMRC will take your personal allowance into account when they work out how much of your income to tax.

How PAYE works:

If your only income is a salary of £25,000 a year, and you are entitled to a personal allowance of £10,000, then HMRC will collect tax on the remaining £15,000 of your salary under the PAYE system.

Your employer must deduct this tax from your monthly wages and pay it over to HMRC.

At the same time your employer must also deduct employee's National Insurance from your wages and pay that over to HMRC too.

### [What are assets?](https://www.freeagent.com/glossary/assets/)
> Assets are what a business owns.

Assets may be large items of equipment such as computers and cars. These are called 'tangible fixed assets'.

### [What is an invoice?](https://www.freeagent.com/glossary/invoice/)

> An invoice is a document that a business issues to its customers, asking the customers to pay for the goods or services that the business has supplied to them. Invoices can be issued either before or after the goods or services are supplied.

### [What is a bill?](https://www.freeagent.com/glossary/bill/)

> A bill is an invoice that one of your suppliers will give you, and which, sooner or later, you will have to pay.

### [What is Turnover?](https://www.freeagent.com/glossary/turnover/)

> Turnover is accounting terminology for sales. Your business's turnover is the sales it makes over a given period of time.

### [What is *net* profit?](https://www.freeagent.com/glossary/net-profit/)

> Net profit is a business's income less all of its day-to-day running costs, but before any tax or interest due to the bank, is taken off.

### [What are bonds?](https://www.freeagent.com/glossary/bonds/)

> Bonds are effectively promissory notes or IOUs. When you invest in a bond, you effectively lend money to a third party, who promises to pay you interest on that money over the bond's lifetime and then to repay your investment at the end of the bond's life.

Typically a bond's life will last for a number of years, during which time the investor will receive interest but can't get their money back. The bond "matures" at the end of its life, and once a bond has matured, the investor is entitled to close the account and collect their investment back.

### <a name="vat"></a>[Value Added Tax (VAT)](https://www.sage.com/en-gb/blog/what-is-vat-uk-vat-basics-from-sage/)

> **VAT** is levied on most goods and services provided by registered businesses in the UK and some goods and services imported from outside the European Union. There are complex regulations for goods and services imported from within the EU. The default **VAT** rate is the standard rate, 20% since 4 January 2011.

As a business, you are probably charged VAT on most of the goods and services you buy. That means charging your customers VAT, keeping VAT records and paying the VAT you’ve collected to HMRC.

Businesses add VAT to the price they charge when they provide goods and services.

This applies to both business and non-business customers. For example:

* A flower wholesaler will add VAT to the amount they charge a florist
* A beauty salon will include VAT in the price they charge to their customers

#### How will I know when to register for VAT?

If you’ve just started in business or have a relatively low turnover, you’re not required to register for VAT. This means you can’t reclaim the VAT you pay when you purchase goods and services.

You will need to register for VAT if your business grows and annual sales of taxable goods and services reach the £82,000 VAT threshold or you expect a taxable turnover of more than £82,000 in the next 30 days.

Registering for VAT means you need to charge your customers VAT. But if your customers are VAT registered businesses they can reclaim the VAT you have charged. It also means you can reclaim any VAT you pay, so reducing your costs.

Rather than paying HMRC all the VAT you collect from your customers, you first deduct the VAT you have been charged on the business supplies you have bought.

Even if you are under the VAT threshold, registering for VAT might boost your profits and can give your business the appearance of being bigger and more established.

**NOTE:** Pay VAT every quarter

### Income tax

> tax levied directly on personal income

Income Tax is tax that's payable on an individual's income, which includes their taxable profit. Every individual can receive a certain amount of income tax-free each year; this is the Personal Allowance. You pay Income Tax on any income you receive in a tax year over and above your Personal Allowance.

The Self Assessment tax return adds up all your taxable income and all the tax you’ve paid so far. The figure it generates is the amount of Income Tax you have to pay by 31st January. You may also have to make a payment on account on 31st July.

### [What is Self Assesment?](https://www.freeagent.com/glossary/self-assessment/)

> Self Assessment is short for the 'Self Assessment tax return', a form that many business owners need to send to HMRC each year to report how much they have earned and from what sources.

Tax is usually deducted automatically from wages, pensions and savings. People and businesses with other income must report it in a tax return.

The term 'Self Assessment' actually refers to the fact it's the individual's - or company's - responsibility to work out how much tax he or she should pay. The Self Assessment tax return is usually just called a tax return.


### National Insurance

> National Insurance is money paid to HMRC by employees, employers, and the self-employed. National Insurance is often abbreviated to NI, or NIC, where the 'C' stands for contributions.

National Insurance is a tax in all but name! It’s money that you pay to the government, which entitles you to receive certain state benefits, such as the State Pension. You pay National Insurance on certain kinds of income, such as salary from a job or earnings from a business, once this income goes above a certain level each year. National Insurance isn’t due on all kinds of income; you don’t pay it on dividends, for example.

National Insurance is divided into different classes, depending on what kind of income you’re earning:

* If you’re self-employed, you pay a flat weekly rate of National Insurance, called Class 2. From the 2015/16 tax year onwards, you will need to include your Class 2 National Insurance liability on your Self Assessment form and pay it through your tax return by the 31st January each year.
* If you’re self-employed you also need to pay Class 4 National Insurance on your business’s profits. Class 4 National Insurance is both calculated and paid through your tax return.
* If you earn a salary, you will need to pay Class 1 National Insurance. Your employer will automatically deduct Class 1 National insurance from your wages before you are paid, and will pass this amount on to HMRC. You don’t have to put Class 1 National Insurance on your tax return because it's already been deducted from your wages and paid to HMRC by your employer.


### <a name="corporation"></a>[Corporation Tax](https://www.gov.uk/corporation-tax)

> The Corporation Tax rate for company profits is 19% *2017*

**NOTE:** Do this each tax year

### Taxable profit
Your profit is the amount that your business has left over once its day-to-day running costs have been subtracted from its income. In your business’s accounts, this information is illustrated in your profit and loss report.

If you’re self-employed, you need to pay tax on your "taxable profit" as part of your Income Tax liability. Taxable profit is an adjusted profit figure that's calculated through your tax return each year.

### Reducing your corparation tax bill
Everything you spend through your company means you are taking away money from any profit. But if like us you're really small and don't really have much expenditure it's easy to end up with a big corparation tax bill. Which is fine, but you could be doing something better with it. Like buying assets that bring in more passive income. Or using this profit to pay into your personal pension (I would reccomend this).


### Capital assets
A capital asset is an asset that will be useful to your business over a long period of time (usually more than two years) and costs more than your usual day-to-day running costs. If your business purchases capital assets during the course of the accounting year, you will need to declare them on your Self Assessment tax return.

Capital allowances are a means of saving tax when your business buys a capital asset. If you claim capital allowances during the course of the accounting year, you will need to declare it on your Self Assessment tax return.

### WIP - How do you calculate how much to give as salary and dividend should be paid?
How ever much you want is based upon the profits so far this financial year and based upon our run rate of X thousand per month.

The Salary takes into account the personal tax limit. If you notice that you get paid £11.850 / 12 = £987.5pm which is tax free. 
Everything paid by dividend them comes under the 50k upper tax bracket. But... dividend tax is less. 

**Note:** A dividend can only be paid if the company has profit

## Forms

* **P60:** The P60 summarises their total pay and deductions for the year.
* **P45:** You need to tell HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) when one of your employees leaves or retires, and deduct and pay the right tax and National Insurance.
* **CT600:** to file a Company Tax Return for accounting periods starting on or after 1 April 2015.
