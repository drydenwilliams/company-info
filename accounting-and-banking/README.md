## Accounting

#### How to Prepare current month payroll report in [FreeAgent](https://support.freeagent.com/hc/en-gb/articles/115001219450-Setting-up-and-running-payroll)

1. Navigate to "my money" > "Payroll"
2. Click "Prepare Month x Payroll"
3. Review the payroll preview
4. Check the date of payment first, it should be last friday or last day of the month (you can choose)
5. Click "Run & Report Month x Payroll"
6. Sign in to Government Gateway using your business ID

**NOTE**: When you submit payroll it tells HMRC how much they are expected to be paid from your company. Then you will need to transfer this amount to HMRC
