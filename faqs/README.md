### [What are bonds?](https://www.freeagent.com/glossary/bonds/)

> Bonds are effectively promissory notes or IOUs. When you invest in a bond, you effectively lend money to a third party, who promises to pay you interest on that money over the bond's lifetime and then to repay your investment at the end of the bond's life.

Typically a bond's life will last for a number of years, during which time the investor will receive interest but can't get their money back. The bond "matures" at the end of its life, and once a bond has matured, the investor is entitled to close the account and collect their investment back.
